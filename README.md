## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:


* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.


The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken
from
the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">UCI
web site</a>:

Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb]
Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy

Time: time in format hh:mm:ss

Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)

Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)

Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)

Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.

Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.


####Making Plots
Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1

For each plot you should

Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

Name each of the plot files as \color{red}{\verb|plot1.png|}plot1.png, \color{red}{\verb|plot2.png|}plot2.png, etc.
Create a separate R code file (\color{red}{\verb|plot1.R|}plot1.R,
 \color{red}{\verb|plot2.R|}plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot,
 i.e. code in \color{red}{\verb|plot1.R|}plot1.R constructs the \color{red}{\verb|plot1.png|}plot1.png
 plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. 
You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.

Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)

The four plots constructed are shown below.
